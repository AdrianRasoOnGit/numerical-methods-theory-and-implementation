# Numerical Methods: Theory and Implementations

## The Theory

Hi! Welcome to the theoretical section of *Numerical Methods: Theory and Implementations*. As you already know (the main header of this index says so!), this repo is made up of two main blocks of content. On one hand, we have materials related to the implementation of numerical-methods algorithms in several languages such as *Python*, *Julia*, and *Fortran*, showing how to code the techniques of the field in these different working environments. On the other hand, we have a set of theoretical explanations about the foundations behind these methods, ranging from a more conceptual understanding to examples that show how to apply them step by step. This latter purpose begins here.

Numerical methods are mathematical tools of profound value, as they underpin an almost endless variety of problems whose solutions we can obtain clearly and precisely, and they play a fundamental role in most of the mechanisms that drive the world. However, even though a large amount of software and libraries allow us to reach these solutions with just a few instructions, it is worthwhile to understand in depth how the approximations used by these methods work, what conditions they require, what makes them better or worse, and, in this sense, how to determine which technique is best suited for a specific problem.

In this theoretical block, we will explore these ideas. For each type of problem that we can tackle with numerical methods, we have prepared a chapter, which is in turn divided into concise descriptions of the different techniques useful for the class of problems it covers. Alongside these descriptions, we provide examples that allow you to see first-hand how these methods can be applied, and that serve as a reference to confirm whether one truly understands how the algorithm works.

## Contents

To divide the problems that structure the presentation of the methods, we follow well-established classifications, such as those found in textbooks like Burden’s (see [references](../README.md). The order presented here also aims to provide a gradual increase in difficulty in both the problems and the techniques, so the recommended approach is to study the material in this sequence. In any case, the explanations try to provide isolated tutorials, so if you are bold enough, you can go further.
